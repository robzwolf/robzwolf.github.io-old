I am a Mathematics and Computer Science student who spends his time working with software development and cybersecurity. I have attended numerous hackathons and have won sponsor prizes from [Amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/) and [Waterstons](https://www.waterstons.com/).

Some of the websites I have been repsonsible for setting up and maintaining include [Music for Celebrations - Barbara Gilbertson](http://barbaragilbertson.co.uk) and [Charcoal Horse](https://charcoalhorse.co.uk).
